# Custom Enumerable Methods

The goal of this project was to create various methods identical to the ones in the Enumerable mixin. In doing so, the inner-workings of methods commonly used in Ruby become demystified.

Some of the new lessons I learned include:
* Recreating common Ruby Enumerable methods to understand them more in-depth
* Using **yield** to execute a block passed into a method
* **Passing arguments** from a method to a block
* **Capturing blocks** to reference them later
